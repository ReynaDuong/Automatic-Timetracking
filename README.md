# Automatic-Timetracking
### Senior Design Project: Spring 2020

This application detects Windows processes and captures logs as well as updates the UI in real time.

This is an enhancement of a previous iteration of this project where this group sucessfully:
- removed Clockify API
  - therefore removing the need for this application to require login/password credentials
- outputted the logs as CSV
- outputted the logs as JSON
  - where the previous iteration only had these processes captured in the UI
- captured the window of each idle process
  - where the previous iteration captured the entire desktop of each idle process
  
  
We utilized Visual Studio and C# to work on this project, and it works locally if you pull this repo and run the "start without debugging" command and are delivering a runnable .msi to Fellows Consulting Group.
